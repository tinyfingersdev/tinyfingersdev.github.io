So I figured I'd give blogging a go while I'm following the [100 Days of SwiftIU][swiftui-100days].

I'm primarily tracking my progress over on mastadon (see profile link in footer), but when I complete one of the projects, I'll probably post some extended bits of information
here from time to time as well.

Feel free to follow along with me as my tiny fingers pound away on my keyboard and maybe we'll all learn something new along the way.
