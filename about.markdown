Who am I? Well, I'm a Software Engineer working at a large retail company based in the U.S where I primarily focus on full stack development using .Net, Java and React.

However, I found myself getting bored, so I decided to learn SwiftUI to pass the time and maybe find something new that I'll enjoy into the future.
